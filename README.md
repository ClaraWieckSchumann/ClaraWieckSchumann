- 👋 Hi, I’m @ClaraWieckSchumann
- 👀 I’m interested in operating system engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software I use.
- 🌱 I’m not a proficient software developpement at all but I plan to learn at a slow pace by contributing to existing softwares. Since I use a lot of different Android applications, I might start to get better in Java and/or Kotlin.
